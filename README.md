# SuccessionPlan_FHE

**SuccessionPlan_FHE** is a privacy-preserving platform designed to enable confidential internal mobility and succession planning for organizations. Utilizing **fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)**, the system allows companies to analyze encrypted employee performance and potential data to identify high-potential talent and plan for critical role succession without exposing sensitive personnel information.

---

## Project Background

Organizations face several challenges in succession planning and internal talent management:

- **Bias and subjectivity**: Manual evaluations can introduce unconscious biases  
- **Confidentiality concerns**: Employee performance and potential data are highly sensitive  
- **Talent leakage risk**: Exposure of talent assessments may affect employee trust  
- **Limited cross-departmental insights**: Data is often siloed, limiting holistic planning  
- **Compliance and fairness**: Organizations need transparent and equitable succession decisions  

**SuccessionPlan_FHE** addresses these challenges by:

- Encrypting all employee data at the source to ensure confidentiality  
- Performing FHE-based analysis directly on encrypted data  
- Providing unbiased succession recommendations  
- Allowing organizations to simulate internal mobility scenarios without revealing identities  
- Maintaining auditable and immutable records for accountability

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Encrypted Employee Profiles**: Store performance metrics, potential ratings, and career preferences in encrypted form  
- **FHE Succession Modeling**: Analyze encrypted data to identify successors for critical positions  
- **Internal Mobility Simulations**: Explore various career path scenarios securely  
- **Anonymous Insights**: HR managers receive recommendations without access to raw employee data  
- **Dashboard Reporting**: Visualize high-potential talent distribution and succession readiness metrics  

### Privacy & Security
